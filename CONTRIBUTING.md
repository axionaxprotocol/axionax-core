## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/axionax-core.git
cd axionax-core

# Add upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/axionaxprotocol/axionax-core.git
```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment

**Prerequisites:**
- Go 1.21+ or Rust 1.75+
- Python 3.10+
- Git
- Docker (optional, for testing)

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r deai/requirements.txt

# Build and run all tests
./run_tests.sh
```

### 3. Create a Branch

```bash
# Update your fork
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

**Branch Naming Convention:**
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation changes
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring
- `test/` - Adding tests
- `chore/` - Maintenance tasks

---

## üíª Development Workflow

### 1. Make Your Changes

- Follow the existing code style
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Add tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Keep changes focused and atomic

### 2. Code Style

**Go Code:**
> *Note: The Go implementation is now considered legacy. New contributions should focus on the Rust/Python/TypeScript architecture.*
 
**Rust Code:**
```bash
# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run linter
cargo clippy
```

**Python Code:**
```bash
# We recommend using tools like `black` for formatting and `flake8` or `pylint` for linting.
# pip install black flake8
black .
flake8 .
```

**Commit Message Format:**
```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style (formatting, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance

**Example:**
```
feat(asr): implement Top-K selection with VRF

Add VRF-weighted random selection from Top-K scored workers.
Includes quota enforcement and fairness boost calculations.

Closes #123
```

### 3. Test Your Changes

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run specific test
go test ./pkg/asr -v

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run benchmarks
make bench
```

### 4. Update Documentation

- Update relevant `.md` files
- Add inline code comments
- Update API documentation
- Add examples if needed

### 5. Commit and Push

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat(asr): implement Top-K selection with VRF"

# Push to your fork
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## üß™ Testing Guidelines

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions/methods
- Mock external dependencies
- Cover edge cases
- Aim for >80% coverage

```go
func TestASRTopKSelection(t *testing.T) {
    workers := generateMockWorkers(100)
    asr := NewASR(64) // K = 64
    
    selected := asr.SelectTopK(workers)
    
    assert.Equal(t, 64, len(selected))
    // Additional assertions...
}
```

### Integration Tests

- Test component interactions
- Use testnet or local network
- Test realistic scenarios

### Performance Tests

```bash
# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Profile CPU
go test -cpuprofile=cpu.prof -bench=.

# Profile memory
go test -memprofile=mem.prof -bench=.
```

## üìñ Documentation Guidelines

### Code Comments

```go
// ASR implements the Auto-Selection Router for worker assignment.
// It scores workers based on Suitability, Performance, and FairnessBoost,
// then uses VRF to randomly select from the Top-K highest-scoring workers.
type ASR struct {
    k int // Top-K size (governance parameter)
    // ...
}
```

### Documentation Files

- Use Markdown format
- Include code examples
- Add diagrams when helpful
- Keep it up-to-date
